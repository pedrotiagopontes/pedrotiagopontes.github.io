						Halma is classic strategy board game, invented around 1883, which is played in a checkered board, typical divided in 16x16 squares. <br>
						In the first phase of this project we developed a prolog application that allowed multiple game modes such as: human vs human, human vs computer and computer vs computer. Furthermore, the game also supported three difficulty levels: easy (random algorithm), medium (greedy algorithm) and hard (minimax algorithm). Finally, the size of the board could also be changed to assure the flexibility and adaptability of the created algorithms. <br>
						In a second iteration, during the Lab of Graphical Interface Apps, our team developed a 3D game interface that used the previous prolog application as a independent module. The project was developed in C++ using OpenGL library and sockets to communicate with the prolog module.

						Developed mainly in PHP using smarty templates, while trying to make the best of HTML5 and CSS3 technologies, our goal was to provide a centralized place were students could share their experiences abroad, search for the best institutions, know about the cities they are planning to live in, and get some feedback from previous students. Moreover, an ad section is also available to help students find and rent their houses or second hand items!

							<li>C++: widely used during all the courses, from simple console programs to games with a graphical interface. A language that I like and feel quite comfortable working with it.</li>
							<li>C: used mostly in the courses of Operative Systems and Networks, to build console programs such as a chat room or a network file sender.</li>
							<li>C#: used recently in the fourth year of my master degree to create distributed business applications.</li>
							<li>Java: As C++, Java was widely used during the entire master to build all kinds of apps, from console ones to a GPS using java swing and open street maps data.</li>
